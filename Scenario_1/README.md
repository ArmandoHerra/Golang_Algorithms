# Scenario 1 - Reverse a String

## Problem Description

You have a function that receives a string as an input and must return the reverse of that string. For example:

- If the input is "Hello", the output should be "olleH".
- If the input is "12345", the output should be "54321".

Constraints

- The string could be empty.
- The solution should handle very short (1 character) or relatively large strings efficiently.

## Run the tests

```sh
$ go test -v
```
